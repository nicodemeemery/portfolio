        <h2>Scientific Project</h2>
	<h3>The Entrep's</h3>
        <p>The Emphore student co-coursing platform won over the jury for its ability to innovate in a seemingly saturated market. My fellow students have developed a connected drive application enabling one student to pick up the drives of several other students in his or her hall of residence.</p>
	<p><a href="academical_project_snowb.html"><img src="chenille.jpg" alt="Photo projet1" width=30% height=10%></a></p>
	<p>This system promotes a collaborative and social model for students who are often far from supermarkets.</p>
	<p><a href="TIPE.html"><img src="bouclier_solidworks.png" alt="Photo projet2" width=31.5% height=10%></a></p>
	<p>I particularly enjoyed working on the legal aspects of our organization, and my work was recognized by the jury.</p>
	<p><a href="factory_robot.html"><img src="poste.png" alt="Photo projet2" width=31.5% height=10%></a></p>
	<p>My team and I were delighted to be awarded the jury's Coup de Coeur prize. This award is just the first step in our project, and I'm particularly looking forward to extending our project, which is already benefiting certain schools in Lille, to new towns.</p>
	<h3>Tire pressure overriding control project</h3>
        <p>My friend Corentin and I have been working on a pressure control system for bicycle tires.</p>
	<p><a href="academical_project_snowb.html"><img src="chenille.jpg" alt="Photo projet1" width=30% height=10%></a></p>
	<p>Our project is part of our shared passion for the world of cycling and competition. In the run-up to the legendary Paris-Roubaix race, cyclists are looking for the best pressure to maximize their performance between the various cobbled sections. The challenge is to find a compromise between the right pressure for the road and the right pressure for the cobbles.</p>
	<p>With our project, we want to make it possible to instantly control the pressure to achieve the ideal pressure zone. </p>
	<p><a href="TIPE.html"><img src="bouclier_solidworks.png" alt="Photo projet2" width=31.5% height=10%></a></p>
	<p>I particularly enjoyed working on the legal aspects of our organization, and my work was recognized by the jury.</p>
	<p><a href="factory_robot.html"><img src="poste.png" alt="Photo projet2" width=31.5% height=10%></a></p>
	<p>The mechanical model is as follows:</p>
	<p>In the context of our research, it is not possible to study the pneumatic supply system, so it is limited to the use of a fixed compressor. After some practical work, we obtained the following design and were able to proceed with the tests. Although the system seems to behave as expected at low pressures, a sealing problem prevents us from reaching pressures in excess of 4 bar. </p>
	<p>In conclusion, even if our project didn't achieve the results we'd hoped for, it did enable us to gain a better understanding of the sporting issues surrounding this question. In fact, it was a pleasure to discover that 2 years after our project, the professionals used a system to control tire pressure at the Paris-Roubaix race. </p>
